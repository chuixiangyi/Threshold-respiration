# Water-limitation
The Matlab code for our paper :"Water limitation will counterbalance increased ecosystem respiration through global warming"
The fold named CubicPolyCluster.m contains the codes, which are used to calculate the to calculate the posterior probability of a site belonging to temperature limited group (T-Group) or precipitation limited group (P-Group) from 212 FLUXNET2015 tower EC sites.
The fold named Fluxnet sites information and groupings.xlsx display the information on the 212 sites used in this paper and their groupings
